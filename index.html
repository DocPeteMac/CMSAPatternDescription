It contains the entire pattern and description regarding to the CMSA rulebook 2019-2020. All pattern are displayed in a 3 dimensional view for a better understanding of the pattern compare to black and white dots on plain paper. Another view is showing a path how to run the pattern. The path, how to run is a suggestion and is the simplest and most efficient way for beginner. It doesn't contain any variation for now. Variation on how to run certain pattern will be implemented in the future.

    <h5>Please read carefully (Disclaimer):</h5>
    <p>All pattern correspond to the CMSA rulebook 2019/2020. Also, all pattern in this App are drawn in scale according to the measurements in the CMSA rulebook 2019/2020. But in 'real life' competition setup, the pattern can look slightly different from those here because the length and the width of the given arena, where the competition is hold, can be different. Sometimes they are longer or shorter or even more narrow. But, mostly the way how to run and shoot the pattern (drawn in the App here), is the way how a beginner should engage the course (pattern). Sure, it is a suggestion. You can modify/ change the way or if the setup at a competition does vary a little bit, adjust the way how you engage the pattern.<br> The developer is not responsible for any mistakes or  misinterpretations and the resulting outcome of the run. It is not allowed to copy, reproduce or use the 3D pictures in any way without permission.<br>Copyright © 2019 Peter Fischer. All Rights Reserved</p>
